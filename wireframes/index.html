			Dennis is a 22 year old adventure enthusiast with a degree in journalism. He has long been a follower of the Adventure Blog, and up until now he had not considered the opportunity of writing for Adventure Blog. Lucky for him, under the contributors nav button, there is a "become a contributor" link.

			Angela is 30 year old Park Ranger looking to get into climbing. She hopes to buy her own climbing harness, but doesn't know where to begin. Under the gear section there are reviews for harnesses and links to where they can be purchased.

			Jeb is 70 years old and retired. He hikes frequently and enjoys the outdoors. He is looking for a website he can jump around and read stories all over the place without getting too lost. The homepage for Adventure Blog has all four story categories with all of the stories cascading underneath their respective spots. Jack can scroll forever exploring all levels of the blog posts based by date posted.

			Brinton is a 28 year old musician looking for a freelance artist to help him create some visuals for his upcoming album release. He was brought to the site through google because freelance is a tag used to describe many projects on the site.

			Tabitha is the 40 year old senior designer at a local design studio. She has a short slot of time and is following up on some resumes. She would like to quickly evaluate and navigate through the work shown. The homepage has thumbnails of all projects as well as a next/previous project link when in each section viewing.

			Sam is a 21 year old design student who wanted to see my portfolio site. Googling my name and design brought him right to it. Having the header image as live text allowed for this also a site title.
